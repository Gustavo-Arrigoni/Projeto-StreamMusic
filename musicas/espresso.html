            <p>Now he's thinkin' 'bout me every night, oh
Is it that sweet? I guess so
Say you can't sleep, baby, I know
That's that me espresso
Move it up, down, left, right, oh
Switch it up like Nintendo
Say you can't sleep, baby, I know
That's that me espresso
<br><br>
I can't relate
To desperation
My 'give a fucks' are on vacation
And I got this one boy
And he won't stop calling
When they act this way
I know I got em'
<br><br>
Too bad your ex don't do it for ya
Walked in and dream came trued it for ya
Soft skin and I perfumed it for ya
I know I Mountain Dew it for ya
That morning coffee brewed it for ya
One touch and I brand newed it for ya
<br><br>

<br><br>
Holy shit
Is it that sweet? I guess so
<br><br>
I'm working late 'cause I'm a singer
Oh, he looks so cute wrapped around my finger
My twisted humor make him laugh so often
My honey bee, come and get this pollen
