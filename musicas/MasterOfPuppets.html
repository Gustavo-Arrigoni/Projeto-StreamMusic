            <p>End of passion play
Crumbling away
I'm your source of self-destruction
Veins that pump with fear
Sucking darkest clear
Leading on your death's construction
<br><br>
Taste me, you will see
More is all you need
Dedicated to
How I'm killing you
<br><br>
Come crawling faster (faster)
Obey your master (master)
Your life burns faster (faster)
Obey your master, master
<br><br>
Master of puppets, I'm pulling your strings
Twisting your mind and smashing your dreams
Blinded by me, you can't see a thing
Just call my name 'cause I'll hear you scream
<br><br>
Master, master
Just call my name 'cause I'll hear you scream
Master, master
<br><br>
Needlework the way
Never you betray
Life of death becoming clearer
Pain monopoly
Ritual misery
Chop your breakfast on a mirror
<br><br>
Taste me, you will see
More is all you need
Dedicated to
How I'm killing you
<br><br>
Come crawling faster (faster)
Obey your master (master)
Your life burns faster (faster)
Obey your master, master
<br><br>
Master of puppets, I'm pulling your strings
Twisting your mind and smashing your dreams
Blinded by me, you can't see a thing
Just call my name 'cause I'll hear you scream
<br><br>
Master, master
Just call my name 'cause I'll hear you scream
Master, master
<br><br>
(Master, master, master, master)
<br><br>
Master, master
Where's the dreams that I've been after?
Master, master
You promised only lies
<br><br>
Laughter, laughter
All I hear or see is laughter
Laughter, laughter
Laughing at my cries
<br><br>
Hell is worth all that
Natural habitat
Just a rhyme without a reason
Never-ending maze
Drift on numbered days
Now your life is out of season
<br><br>
I will occupy
I will help you die
I will run through you
Now I rule you too
<br><br>
Come crawling faster (faster)
Obey your master (master)
Your life burns faster (faster)
Obey your master, master
<br><br>
Master of puppets, I'm pulling your strings
Twisting your mind and smashing your dreams
Blinded by me, you can't see a thing
Just call my name 'cause I'll hear you scream
<br><br>
Master, master
Just call my name 'cause I'll hear you scream
Master, master</p>
